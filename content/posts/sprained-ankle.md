## How do you deal with stress? {#stress}
---
*Intro to psychology.*

I think I already deal with my stress pretty well. Frustrations and pressures certainly exist, but I have
conditioned myself thoroughly to not let them run my life and dissuade me from achieving my goals. For
example, I currently combat my tardiness issue by assuring myself that firstly, it is out of my control when my ride runs late,
and secondly, detention is not the end of the world. In fact, as a realist, I am
able to accept my tardiness as part of my life and see it for what it is: of course detention is annoying,
but I can also get some homework done in the time allotted. Another example of effective coping relates
to my job at The Paper Store. Sometimes my manager overschedules me and gives me late shifts, which
affects my ability to complete my schoolwork due the next day. In these situations, I simply remind
myself that missing one homework or getting something done in advisory are not sins. In general, when I
get stressed, I do what I can and I try my best to be satisfied with that.

Although I am already well-versed in coping with stress, there is always room for improvement. Looking
at my coping strategies list, I realize that I do most of them only on Fridays and the weekends. Rarely do
I go to the park or on a drive or a run outside of my sports during the school week. Perhaps carrying out
one of these strategies could lift up my spirits and help me get through the week in a more passionate
mood. Additionally, I believe I could put more effort into addressing a major personal frustration: my
poor sleeping habits. Do I really think that getting three hours of sleep one night and twelve hours the
next night is an effective sleep schedule? Is it beneficial to my health? Of course not. This problem
affects every other facet of my life, including stress levels, as my ability to accomplish goals becomes
undermined by waking up late or sleeping through plans.

I took a break to meet a friend for dinner. I told him I’d meet him in the square, so give me a half an hour
to walk there. Leaving from my grandma’s house the fastest is to take Myrtle Street—the memory lane
of my youth. I used to walk this everyday so, a force of habit, I note the pretty little one-floor house
numbered 50 and painted the most pleasing electric blue. But it’s been 4 years since I’ve really walked
here. A sigh of relief, for my favorite house is still there. The white blossom trees do not compare; they
smell of fish dead or alive. Once I was 16, inside dead and alive. The trees 72, in the woods I sprained
my ankle on a practice run for cross country. I am so fragile my teammates carried me from twisted
branch and sunken stone back to school, as I melted to jelly stuck stupid to my friend’s spine--her
piggyback arch. After dunking my injure site into the school basement icebath, a colossal metallic tub of
arctic water, PT said you’re free to go so I hopped a bus and walked home from my stop. Alas- my
bandaged ankle, lagging on the free one, lengthened my Myrtle stroll from a skip and jump to 40 minutes
full of whisper-yelling fuck fuck fuck spaced between complimentary winces, the whole way home.
Looking dumb, booksmart, for sure. As a freshman there’s a day I count each step from the start of
Myrtle to the end: once walking at a diagonal angle and once walking on one sidewalk and waiting until
the end of the street to cross to the other side. I wouldn’t usually spend more than 20 minutes here.
However, the curiosity urged to test which path was most efficient and I’d just about learned the idea of
the tangent in geometry although inapplicable, at least related cousinly to the hypotenuse and 5-12-13
trinities to make it worth mentioning. I’m a sore sight, secretly even more noetic than I appear; the girl
who repeats injuries tripping on rocks in a noncontact sport wondering if I can get far enough away from my body to forget it exists.

## A stab at a poem {#poem}

*English. Inspired by “Untitled” by Inma Lorente.*

{{< figure src="../../images/inma-lorente-untitled.png" alt="Untitled by inma lorente" width="70%" height="70%" >}}

They say the best time to write is the early morning,

before light dawns softly on the pane,

so novelists, poets, etchers, and scribes must think best

before dawn and after dusk. But tis’ untrue

for he, with weary eyes and greasy hair, unfastening

the latches of his case: he is an insomniac

at best. Two, three, four ante meridiem he arises,

and thus begins writing hour for the tired, blue, angular, bent,

as the street lights glow for the neighborhood watch

and as the desk lights glow to fill up negative space—no bother,

no bother! The sides of his face creased with anxious sweat

don’t seem to bother, slyly seen through the sereneness

of his smile, and with his suit on to feign busyness and business,

it seems he’s got his world in his hands. Perhaps today

he pretends to write for the local paper, a flash fiction,

A bestseller! And tomorrow he will sign off

copies for the fans at the local coffee shop, doing all so

in a state of delirium, fading continuum, transience,

all in his head, with the aromas of rising espresso bean

and black sharpie wafting but never existing,

because he can’t get the words on paper and he doesn’t know

why or how. All seen through the sereneness of his smile

and the desperate hopefulness in his pale,

Pale eyes. Though right words never appear, there is no doubt

that he will undo the latches of the Regalus

again and again to show the world his potential and potency

of thought, of the linguistics, the mindset, the ideas,

the limitlessness of imagination—or so he thinks,

again and again. But weariness and delusion most often equal

lost dreams and loneliness, missed opportunity,

and with every verse he writes comes the pain of reality because

the reality hits as the sad life of a lone middle-aged man

who has to trudge to the office day after day doing taxes,

accounting, statistics, stocks, nothing of importance

to him and his world. The heaviness in his brow holds the weight

of old words when they said you can’t be a writer,

that doesn’t pay and novelists poets etchers scribes,

they don’t get paid. It echoed at seventeen

and it echoes at forty, and they say what a successful life

you’ve led as a businessman—hah!—a successful life

indeed. An insomniac at best, he can’t afford

to know the time: the time that has passed,

the time that is current, and the time

that is left. There’s no clock in the studio,

and he’s still writing sensibly senseless to wear off the pain

as street lights still glow for the neighborhood watch

and the desk lights still glow for negative space,

like false illumination because his ideas never leave

his head. The bulb flickers and falters till it ceases to fire.

I discover the matter of writing. In 9th grade English, I read ee cummings and that poem I can never
recall the title of, just that line “anyone lived in a pretty how town” and I feel, deeply, what’s the matter
with and purpose of free capitalization as completely captivating. For once I am captured, enjoying the act of being
in a classroom. Lowercase feels anonymous, and sometimes I want to live in an anonymized world where
I know people by pseudonym, their ideas alone and ee has come alive by that to me. That’s the
beginning for me. ee, that’s where I learn to bend the rules among genre and grammar, namely across
experiment in pitting words which might bicker that close together in a sentence and in approximating
definitions in hopes the reader will too, when I use a word I only know the first of three dictionary
entries for, in translating nouns to verb to give a concept action, since all concepts are in fact, figuring a
performative. In 10th grade English I’m arriving at my first passion. Heinegg reintroduces the image of
the “Renaissance man” and I think, that is either me or what I want to be. But what’s the difference in it
anyway? I am writing my mind so often, so spirited, so naive in every assignment for his high school
class, a rarity encouraging unapologetic experimentation. I just want to know things as they are, not as
watered down and briny and specialized. Does that make sense? This year I am terrified; I really felt
dying even more than I’m ashamed to say that I wanted it, but this is a reason to stay. I will become somewhere
between poetry, prose, and the polemical and at times the cruelly reflexive/self-aware, but today not
yet. My growth is murky, still, is not was and in the weeds. There’s a ways to go from the first inklings
of seeing your soul, your life now a melting rorsarch test dependent on the subtlety between a good and
bad trip.

CHNOPS is not enough, it will never be enough. It’s never an explanation, just like MANIA won’t be for
world war i and those putrid pol/dip soc/eco int/cult charts too (a surefire way to memorize the
political/diplomatic, social/economic, intellectual/cultural factors involved in any historical moment for
AP tests) that I will loathe in the following year. I keep sketching at that three-way chart over and over
like my life depends on it, and it does, does it. My
perfectionism knows how quick I’d rise to believe the promise of this euthanizing education.

## Slow run {#slow-run}
---

Everything slows down on a run. I picture me, outside, right now: my blood is pumping, calves kicking up
behind me, sound of my sneakers on pavement below. This is idealistic. The truth I swallow hard. I can’t
and shouldn’t run in weather under...55 degrees (no wind chill), otherwise a familiar pain will creep then
shoot from the base of my jaw to ear to skull, figuring like that robo-bee-drone menace crawling
through the sinews of your frontal lobe in Black Mirror’s “Hated by the Nation.” The cold air has an
unnamed effect on the bones underneath my face, to say it gracelessly, because it’s no elegant thing and TMJ or 
bruxism is another name and face for the consequence of serial schooling. In high school, I run cross
country and track, anyway, in the brisk weather. Running is one of the few things I can do to feel what
‘slow’ means again—have you ever felt how long it takes to run one mile where the end is visibly ahead
of you? And people still ask me why I like running, every other sport’s punishment. I just like that
`excruciating slow` much more than the other daily machoistic things I do, the latter which makes me
forget, or no longer care for the pace of my days going by.

A hobby or habit stripped bare starts as coping mechanism, wishing to end like dripping petals
blossomed in springtime dew.
