*Adapted from installment #4 of nose boop collection. An exploration of cyclothymia and the stuff that runs through family trees and friend group chats when you just. can't. stop. running. away.
The backdrop is the summer between college and my first full time job.
Do you agree with this: similar to how technology has permeated every sphere and industry and tech skills will be required out of all labor markets, will awareness of mental health discourse have to permeate every relationship?*

## Shower thoughts (praise for the passionless) {#shower-thoughts}
---


On the road, I have stopped asking my hosts how to make the shower work, i.e. which ways to turn the
knobs to ideal temperature, do I leave the metal bead string alone to dangle, or discovering the
deformed zucchini shaped handle pulls in two dimensions instead of one. I have stopped asking since I
am normally a burden to begin with in my scattered, overextended behavior.


I am often uninvited, though welcome, and have delicately weaned an afterthought of invitation by
swearing on my low-maintenance. yo, hey, im a fly on the wall! My hair is healthy to spite the circus of
store brands and household favorites that gloss through it (fingers always crossed I put the bottles back
facing the right way to leave no trace). Today, it does not spite the chlorine, instead cowers like a
weeping willow bends, a crack along its spine. Phone buzzes after shower. Phone to ear, k’s voice
elevates as I disclose my timeline for job training in india. He is going to Australia, the same time, for job training.


I sleep with chlorine in my bleached hair until the color turned wretched and blistering. Next time I stand in
the mirror, I am staying at p’s house which knows the beauty and convenience of central air, and I stand
below a vent in the guest room. The cold gusts thin out before me to cover the room, like a disarray of a
thousand little feathers dissolving to a thousand
little pockets of air. Beneath skin, my insides are hot and boiling over. I smile, the cyclothymic manic
still uninspired, still onsetting to peak this season of the year and every other and I smile, hard.

The boldness which is uncontained, never goes unquestioned. By habit, I think into existence the
very lack I feel. like depression smokes a friend’s cigarette for the sensation of paper
against tongue. When I turn a corner in a familiar place I wish what I saw was completely foreign.


**A YEAR EARLIER in 2018** k and i are driving up the Bay and through silicon valley after I show up uninvited...and I
say, “I think I am going to drop my American studies major. But I don’t see myself living here (in the
valley where all the tech is) either.” A profession, k turns his head from the wheel and the spotlight
floods shotgun. He spits his drink, if he had one I imagine, because my point is blatant: my college study
has felt meaningless.


We are agreeing that the money in tech makes the burnout worth it in the short run—for him that means
the bore of the work (intellectual fizzle, the kid’s a brainiac) and for me, fizzling ethically and spiritually.
But then he starts to take very, very personal offense. American studies is YOUR thing! After 3 years of satirizing my field for its leftist and impractical lean, he’s
pushing the importance. He’s riled and his drink is spilling goddamn everywhere. How could you leave it
behind? HOW COULD YOU?


The awareness hits that we are whizzing down the freeway, 80 mph, like crashing down to earth on an
asteroid version of hard. Now, the offense of the curve of the roads is taken and the whipping and
lashing is personal. Out the window I cannot stitch a pattern of stable image or scenery. California. What
is it meant for something to my ‘my thing’, ‘mine’, when nothing has ever felt like that in the first place. I
know it is selfish and privileged to care.. or not care at all.


Some months the pressure of triviality is so immense I don’t mind a bad accident. I don’t mind if our
names, whiplash, and crash were all in the same sentence, and I’m not saying we would since k is a very
good driver but I’m saying I wouldn’t mind.


sobered beyond sobriety and i know the triviality is speaking. I am still chewing the residue of spring.


*-4 months before then -118 showers before then*

By the end of my 3 years in college, I prove that I can dedicate myself to almost anything without a
second thought. Surprising friends I sign up to become (basically) an amateur
logger for another work-study. In a blizzard, I saw down invasive shrubs and miniature trees. Weeks
later it’s 90 degrees and I cough among billows of smoke as my tearing eyes give way to fire, controlled
burn on the dry, dry prairie. To surface a 50 hour
courseload, two jobs and leaking head, the mixed episode- you let the blood drip and dry. Mostly, I close off. 
Some months of my life the pressure of triviality is immense and everything I’m dedicated feels
unspecial, to me.

*+4 months back to then +118 showers back to then*

In that car down silicon valley bathing in sobriety. the weakly linked state. Sobriety is limiting
consumption and believing the present. We’re barreling and it’s making me think of all the ways... that closing this door opens the infinity of sitting in the moment.
The ways the guilt of giving up is the guilt i'm taught to become.
I can think of all the
ways I am so sure of this as the ‘process’ of individuation that I have never been so confident in the face of losing something + others’ unbelieving in
my entire life.


Giving up the label ‘humanities’ once I find the liberal arts is still obsessed with labels as is everywhere
else, like studying French proves youre romantic and social justice proves youre humane. I find it alright
(even permissible) to arrive empty at times, praising the passionless.

## Tidepool poem {#tidepool}
---
In the English dictionary we find (def) nominal: something that has almost no value and/or exists in name only;
syn. trifling and insignificant, trivial.


In language we possess among 200,000 words but only use a small subset to describe our possessed
lives. To millions of people, these words are known by name not experience as often the result of
education (ie the penitentiary), and to others vice versa (ie imposter syndrome).


Lingering on the tiny and between, there are moments where I pronounce nominal as phenomenal as
nominal back again, because surely nothing exists in name or life only and nothing lacks value, and there
I flourish. There is my ego little girl in a tidepool, for when there is no early or easy metaphor (*for why
is there all shades of pain and reduction*), I shall find one in the spirals of shells and ebbing transitions.

Each day the representative verb of my life will feel less like pages flipping and recycled droplets of
water tumbling down my face, in different people’s showers. . .

<div style="text-align: center;margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;">
the lilt of shore break.

showering

my breath. my breath at 7000 ft.

gasping at something shocking to balloon

clouds in my lungs. sun in my mouth.

unevenness.

skirt too short- change.

shirt too gay- change.

shadow of needle on the street

one block down lined up for club and catcall.

stars chase rotation

like tomorrow’s morals

a twinkling star cast on closed eyelid.

missing the morrow

spry as river running, borderlands dirt

caked into a rusty hinge or diamond of barbed wire, otherizing.

silhouette, then in color.

inaudible whisper on rock summit and high desert radiating

silhouette of head on shoulder.

silhouette of the words truffula tree

for we speak for them.

of the words growing old.

it all growing old and I hope, just as in justice and just

holding your eyes with my calloused, aged hands.

## Is suicide an abnormal psychology {#abnormal-psychology}
---


There’s a comfort in diagnosis where I can let nature take over.
But as I let the words linger I wondered how for me this idea isn’t new; hovers like dust around corners
and looks like something’s always floating there. Paradigms already in motion before those October
stars align. oct 97. At the inception of my life is the idea that depression alters materially.


Depression, as more than a figment of how i feel. The union of nature and nurture, the
thing my mom studied as a biopsychologist at tufts, is continued with me. I crawl out the womb and take
my first two breaths as two lives of two harvard students are taken early. The union of nature and
nurture in my family decrees that we will never know if depression is a) a predisposition or b) the
consequence of environmental factors- does it take roots in an ivy league administration whos mental health infrastructure is so inadequate that
it plays a role in driving students to murder and suicide. is that why I will never know my
aunt, whose murderer committed suicide. does it
come, seasonally, from never before having seen snow, pushed out from Saigon to san diego to boston
lastly, with only half your family, apart by global politics, but not apart from your abusive dad. is that
why s.a.d. lamps, especially the one in minnesota don't work.


I demand asking why: though at days end for me nature and nurture are
muddled. Genetically we are altered by the experiences we have after we’re born (and those of our
parents before), as trauma is proven to do over years and years and years, at times instantly; only
because we could never isolate the human from science to prove we aren’t.


I’m an inconsistent conversationalist. I don’t claim to know anything most of the
time but run with my gut. to see if I can be convinced of a counter. When asked if suicide is an abnormal
psychology, I have no idea so I use the argument that through all of evolution an individual’s prime
motive is survival, furthering itself in biology or even artistically if its aware of its impermanence. I am a
debater. Therefore AFF., abnormal.


I make good guesses most of the time, but what do I say when my friend j reveals her sister has
attempted 3 times this summer while she was away, the guilt she feels because they’ve never been
close, my friend who confides in so few people. She states it like a fact which doesn’t facilitate
response. Anything I say is no better than a blank stare. I’m sitting at the restaurant feeling
something rise, like I don’t know if antidepressants or any kind of support and probably not involuntary
hospitalization can help her in time. This has been 2 years in the making, the length
of time ive known j, but surely a decade for her and her family with relapse after relapse. At days end
I’ve seen darkness as a contagion that cannot be fended alone exclusively or by others exclusively. This
fight is ceaseless for no matter what lengths j’s family goes to support the sister—and they will continue
to as is right—change cannot happen unless the afflicted subscribes to the long road of trying for it.
The cold truth is the patient has to work twice as hard to (1) ask for help and (2) grasp for autonomy or
rewire the involuntary, especially when the affliction’s the brain. With neurological repair you need both
external and internal attribution for why you’ll be above the water soon.


Like I said, I make guesses most of the time but every once in awhile I will make a firm case. Not just
for the sake of convincing I mean. This is one of those times where I say exactly what I mean: the
undercurrent is I can’t stand the pop culture of mental wellness. While well-intentioned, the saturation of
media and its growth as an industry (of wellness) has turned it didactic.


1. alessia cara and logic releasing a song with a suicide hotline number as its title. in of itself really
impactful, raising traffic/calls by 27% in the month after the release. This, VERSUS entertainment shows
making any entertainment out of suicide and mental health and additional death (mostly looking at 13
reasons why, but there are other culprits) without addressing the topics responsibly, instead pointing to
blurbs at the end of an episode with a bunch of hotline numbers to call if you have x issue after being
triggered from watching, as ‘responsible’ behavior. same infuriation goes toward any content creator or
commenter on a forum that slaps these hotline blurbs at the end of their content, and doing nothing
more, as a sad excuse for taking responsibility for whatever triggering shit you’ve posted.


2. in 11th grade this guy who asked to prom one of my xc teammates ‘only cause she's hot,’ and told me so,
and tried to get me to set it up, also suggested that I start volunteering for a suicide prevention hotline
as material for my college app. he said he had been doing it for a few months and that ‘training was
pretty chill’ so there shouldn’t be a problem with me trying out even if I think I can’t do it. consider that
hotline responders may be volunteers, so unprepared for whatever is thrown at them. contrast with #1


3. white people clinging to pretty and flowery instagram mantras (cut off toxic people / no
one can make you feel inferior without your consent / treat yourself / love your flaws / do a face mask /
eat chocolate / spend / cancel all your commitments) as their surefire way to help those who are
suffering. the mental wellness industry becomes yet another instance of WEIRD psychology- Western,
Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. Fashion is shirts with ‘my anxieties have anxieties’
written in cursive on them, depression and anxiety as crudely self-diagnosed and ‘trendy’. when you
think about the number of psych studies performed on American college campuses vs. not in the realm
of depression and anxiety, you start to SEE the discourse of mental wellness as a mere reflection of the
these populations with inherited sociocultural capital and involved norms (individualist, consumerist,
meritocratic), expressing a stylized sort of truth.


4. the purism or the idea that “toxicity” or your toxic environment that you put yourself in is the root of
your unhealthiness, OR that everyone’s problem is brain chemistry, which can only be modified with
celexa Lexapro Effexor etc. this purism calls for education and listening to others experiences. binary
thinking is especially damaging to, rendering invisible the bipolar and schizophrenic communities, the
most stigmatized identities within mental health by cultural and bureaucratic measures. the most seriously
mentally unwell are still largely neglected by circles and structures of power in the mental health industry, in favor
of lower order symptomatic disorders like generalized depression and anxiety, ADD and OCD. for the
highly symptomatic, they are often in need and always deserving of reliable care that’s both clinically
chemical + encouraging of self-awareness. for the highly symptomatic, the nuance is crucial.


5. speaking of education, the general need for empathy and sharing the weight of the world among each
other. simply attempting to learn the ropes of trauma-sensitive healing, and how to spread positivity if
you are able. if you are in a group of friends or in a family unit, take the time to check in on everyone
but go further, again if you are able—don’t leave it all to the ‘mom friend’ or the cancer or the kindest
one or your literal mom because you don’t think you’re a helper type, or more frankly you are selfish
with your time. consider your limits (what’s really exhausting vs what is narcissistic) as you rush, then
hesitate to point someone towards talk therapy or a mental health professional. strengthen individual
relationships. most controversially // maybe its time to recognize that everyone needs to become mental
health proficient in a world where there’s a shortage of ‘experts’, the expertise is only quasi-successful,
and the number of afflicted individuals is growing in our eye-buggingly disconnected oversaturated personally
paradoxical society. `alike how technology has permeated every sphere and industry and tech skills will
be required out of every labor market, awareness of mental health discourse might have to permeate every
relationship` – and maybe we all can’t help everyone in small ways and the validity of a ‘professional’
behind mental health remains, but we can all try harder to be the person who shows up.


In my personal culture, the union of nature and nurture decrees that there’ll be days where you’re above
the water. There is history here of cyclical growth and respected choices. When you walk in my door I
am respected by my choices. For me I’d like your partiality to my brain, as connected to a familial,
ancestral past and individual past, but as a future which I determine regardless. When you walk in my
door you don’t tell me what I need; you listen for i cant be my own hero every time, but I have watched
the nature, celexa, and zoloft work and fail again for this family tree, rooted in gene over years and
years. you listen, so I wish for internal attribution explaining why, perhaps the wave is passing and you
help me see to it.


Industries of wellness are lazy, but I feel relieved. On august 28th the travel doctor says they don’t
prescribe the old generation of malaria meds anymore, the ones that trigger depressive, manic, and schizophrenic episodes in susceptible patients. I
float at the surface, learn to live with what’s below the water.

## Pina colada on father's day {#pina-colada}
---


Most people don't know i LOVE weddings.


For extra credit in high school english class, I type up a 3 page document planning my wedding
(amidst a unit on pride and prejudice). It’s a destination wedding in Australia. There
will be ~30 invitations and whoever says yes will have their travel compensated.
Catered by my favorite French-cambodian restaurant The Elephant Walk, dinner will be followed by a
reception with live band music. We will dance all night on the beach; I’ll make circles with the dress
of my dreams (muted rainbow), glitter raining down. The bridal party is everyone in unmatching attire. I will be 27.


My mom believes that after your first wedding, a second one is unnecessary even if you remarry. “You
already did the whole shebang once.” I’ve been secretly hoping for my mom to have a second wedding,
even if there’s no official second marriage, because I love a good party and especially one that
celebrates love. “But what about the fun of a party?” Resigning, I know it’s a long shot.


In the u.s. the divorce rate is on the decline, at 17.5 per 1000 people (1.75%) in 2010. However the
number of americans who are currently divorced still rises since couples seldom become un-divorced–
and that’s where you hear the statistic that 50% of marriages end in the u.s..


From the extent of my knowledge, my mom divorced my first step father in 2008 when the rate was
18.7/1000 (1.87%).


1.87 seems stinted. Within one of my group chats—we make a point to celebrate little things like every
drip of pop culture tea and every holiday—we joke on a Sunday in June that no one’s said


*HAPPY FATHER’S DAY:*


p’s dad I don’t know too much about, except that he was/is an alcoholic and can’t take care of much
besides chickens.
t’s similarly, though he drove me and t home once and seemed fine, but then I heard otherwise.
m’s dad is gone in a different sense, rarely ever going into it.
f’s dad is complacent and the mom a raging, also alcoholic, in many ways abusive parent. I don’t know
which is worse, honestly, as media normalized the roles reversed.
in s’s house I’ve always tiptoed because the caring of his words morphs to lethality in my mind.
something I would never say out loud, I try to separate s from that kind of fear.


w I have known for too long. w’s hurt hurts me too. twice, the cellular guy comes knocking and asking
for whoever pays the phone bill. w and w’s brother answer two separate times, giving two different
answers for what day of the week dad will show. “oh, so you got a weekend dad too?” cellular guy gets
it, the malaise of a relationship that cannot age well.


g is the one we might be jealous of, or at least secretly thinking is so lucky. At times I stop to remember
that it is easy for no one. when they came out tee-ball dad said I don’t care if you’re pink or purple or blue..
which sounds like the chaste optimism of love, simon , might be good enough for g, and yet I know how
much of yourself you can still hide in the light, at a half revelation.


With each year of your life that passes by, you either become more like your parents or less so. They
say as truism that every young adult is afraid of becoming their parents; and yet a chunk of the
millennial-genz cusp generation only really knows one biological parent. 1.87 * a span of 10 years (a
very conservative guess of 2000-2010 for the years a millennial/genz-bearing couple could have gotten
divorced) = 18.7% of our parents have gotten divorced. But this math does not account for what's beyond the law: separated,
widowed, unhappily married parents, completely absent parents which bumps up the number of kids who might hate their
parents from the second tenth percentile to an unknown amount, matching the qualitative
experience of this generation.


Fear of becoming cuts infinite ways. It could look like.. your strength when your mom’s heartbroken,
because the gifts dad gave you are right from five below’s checkout aisle. “he just doesn’t know you at
all.” It could look like.. the checkered streets you’ve been groomed toward prodigy along, your uptight
parents asking what you’ve been reading but rarely how you are, so how you are is you drive to planned
parenthood alone in the freedom of those checkered streets. It looks like clinginess and aversion. It
looks like learning of stoicism in the sixth grade and feeling deeply that was you, 8 in the car, by the
chinatown gate the two about to kill each other till your mom’s kicked out and headed separate ways. It
looks like wondering now if they knew how scary it looked but if they were unable to control it anyway.
It is the fear of inheriting ugliness. Holding back for at times you question if you are a deeply bad
person, and if there are truths you cannot control or escape from, in the ways we all hold back. Every
good person questions.


I love pina colada, the virgin kind from my mom’s wedding.
