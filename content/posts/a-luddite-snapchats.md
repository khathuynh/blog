## {#video}
From january to march 2017, i decided to document my learnings in california through snapchat story, which i then later saved to ‘my memories’ in the app. i didnt have snapchat before this program and getting used to recording something almost every day was mental floss. in the end, i’m glad i tried it out, as now ill have a reel of footage to look back on some of the greatest months of my life so far!
