A romanticist muses on ethical consumerism.*

Today I am really scared to write because it’s been a little bit of time since I last opened my notebook.
The longer I am away from striving toward craft, the stronger is my desire to glean perfection. Procrastination,
unproductivity, dwindling confidence. The fear grows in me not for I have nothing new to say but that
my articulation will be too fragile for others to understand. Today I break the spell before it takes upon a
life of its own; and in getting these initial honesties down I already feel worlds closer to what I might be
about to get at.


There’s the pot I painted years ago for James’s birthday chamomile that died, and I stare at the dirt crisp
ash littered on the rim. Mom’s boyfriend has been using it as an ash tray. My eyes start to blur and the
rim a grey ellipse. and today is so weird cause the low is 39 and the high 80.


The environment precludes all when I write. Over the years my mom and her boyfriend have really
turned our back porch into a lively space, yet I have discovered it as backdrop to writing only today!
The birds are chirping. They are out of sight. Half dead trees and a gentle brush of wind compose me.
Or console? No, compose. I hear the birds though, where are they? Somehow I don’t regret not having
done this before as I am only lifted by the thought of what words will fall in place next. A little early in
season for mosquitos, I wonder of if one bit me now, would it please suck the poison out of my body and
at last, impregnate in me the golden lush of summer. I’ve been sad for too long. The seasons. Fall to winter,
thinking about the Question.


Today I remember back to my younger admiration of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thoreau and
their likes. And in a jump further backwards I relate the names of Pythagoras, Euclid, Plato, Rosseau,
Kepler and other masterminds that have generated our worldview and entirety. I have been reading,
terribly slowly, a book on the Question: Does the world in fact embody beautiful concepts...to say, `is the
world a work of art?` To answer, we marry our tools of analyses for science and art. So often divorced, 
the two may be intimate after all.


I am a romanticist in more ways than one but one way I am is crystalized clear in investigating the
Question: I believe reality must be beautiful for no reason at all other than to serve and instill purpose
within itself.


quick aside: (maybe you would say I am conflating beauty and purpose, to which I would reply in the
natural world, the ability to perceive a beautiful quality around you is evidence of your perception having
evolved to recognize something nice in itself, i.e. your perception thinks your perception itself is pure
and good, and thus evidences deeper purpose. concrete scenario is you fancying the symmetry in a
flower as it follows golden ratio, while, or perhaps..because..your eyes are of a precise design to
perceive symmetry as something unique and congruent and so the evolution of your eyes and our
understanding of relations between labels for Number is a reflection of a beautiful world in essence).


Because if reality were not beautiful and purposeful and the claim untrue, everything conceived of
design would be of, alternatively, mistake. Lana Del Rey poses, “walking down the city streets / is it by mistake or design / 
I feel so alone on a Friday night,” the turbulence in her voice
ebbing through my adolescent nights (Born to Die). And that’s the scariest reality of them all,
one where conscious intelligence came forth from existing by some fluke or flaw and our own self-
understanding alongside an accident, but a torture of philosophy nonetheless. Like, I think accidental +
purposelessness reality is even worse than plain old nihilism, realized—for in the former there is the
miracle of an appearance of singularity and significance that comes to be, which is miraculous for no
reason vs. vanilla nihilism where you actually embody nothing mattering, nothing specializing, in its
blatant mundanity and it is exactly what it is. It’s asking, would you rather eat poop that tastes like food,
or food that tastes like poop except the second option is just literal shit (poop that tastes like poop).


But our world’s not that simple. Our world is full of ambiguous miracles that may or may not have an
artistic signature; perhaps traceable to a source, perhaps forever obscured.


To have to wonder if the rise in adoption of nihilsm is (a) a coincidence of a
purposeless and nihilistic reality, like nothing within nothing within nothing, or (b) something of
significance in a significant reality, is hell.


As a romanticist, I sure as hell hope nihilism has some elegant reason for existing in humanity's psyche.


In the ways I’m not a romanticist which make me seem like one, I think a part of me has always been
obsessed. With perfection, concepts made beautiful and symmetrical..sure, but above all that, with a
relentless sense of objectivity. This defies the romantics’ crush on the subjective.


A part inside feels incomplete if I cannot align the World with my Mind. 
I used to hate that thought exercise: what if we all see different colors? As,
two people stare at the same American flag blowing in the wind, but your “red” stripes equate to my
“purple.” That your label for red equates to my label for purple, and if we switched eyes and brain and
nervous system, that would be the only way you could ever see my version of the flag?


When I was little, I was afraid of the present—how no one recorded the menial events of the day as I
did, playing tapes of memory back on my mind, and how everyone else was smitten by their
misremembered memories in dramatizing or rose-tinting or omitting details, children and adults alike, no
care of what was false or real—scared of the present for its unreliability to serve narrative and
ourselves. If I knew the word for solipsism when I was 8, I’d say solipsism stinks. At 16, the reason is
because the self can’t remember itself, just a hallucination or fossil of, if the present is infinitesimally
small. Reality, as such, is severely fragmented by our own being.


At 16 I texted my best friend something like, “I want to know the highest truth, what’s really real and
happening out there in oppressive systems. Beyond media propaganda. To come up with the right solution.” Growing up, politics
came into play to style my need for objectivity all the more important—socially important. In an apolitical
household, my mom never was one to vote and believed the government to be an oligarchy, not a
democracy. I strayed. I sought to vote with words, actions, and dollar in looking for an ideologically pure
politic to adopt in mid high school. I craved a one-size-fits-all guiding principle to help me become the
ethically perfect consumer. Rejecting polarizing affliations, I was crushed by the impossibility of achieving moral perfection.
It was all I wanted.
In high school, politics grew me up against the sky, and the sky limited me. The truth is never pure, nor perceivable.


If ambiguity is what fundamentally exists and nothing more, from it can more emerge? Can ambiguity
give way to perfection / objectivity / purity in the alignment of perspectives? Is it enough to say, reality
is where enough lines of perception meet (where enough people see eye to eye)? If I can believe that,
then there is hope. Nihilism can be a side effect of a non-nihilist world if purpose and beauty, in the
convergence of relative views, fractalize.


Maybe, then, I can be okay. I can accept the distance we each are forced to feel from each other, and at
that from all things in the realization of the subjective. Lana Del Rey, 13 Beaches, “I don't belong in the
world, that's what it is / Something separates me from other people / Everywhere I turn”. I can know
now there is something essentially realized by the similarity in difference, something humanity embodies
so well. And it is beautiful, this purposeful thing (echoing my conflation).


`One cannot be an ideologically perfect consumer of politics, social scapes, and existence.` That is the bottom
line. Right above that line is tolerance of ambiguity. If you can subscribe to the spirit of context and the
work required to understand it in varying settings, and to the positive wonder of similarity within
difference, you can get closer. Closer to what? Closer to humanity. And perhaps the beauty behind (the
madness, The Weeknd and Hamlet) critiquing our own inner belief systems. Although you cannot
fight all of them, you pick your battles equipped by what you know and are open to know. You are moved
internally (egoistically) and externally (socially) to build a relative view among other touched souls.
Now, you must get started with your articulation, your craft. From one romanticist to the next.


(inspired by a sort of bible _A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature's Deep Design_ by Frank Wilczek; “The
world is a work of art, and its deepest truths are ones we already feel, as if they were somehow written
in our souls”)
