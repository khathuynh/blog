American high school, white privilege and whitened beauty. Deliciously naive and binary.*

<div style="text-align: center;">
if i was white / id have hazel eyes / take pictures and sigh / realize real eyes real lies
people say, hey! / theyre so pretty, id say / “yeah, they change color / everyday.”
the waves of my mane / are darker shade / with the tips fading / to chesnut
flyaways tucked / i could curl AND straighten / a two way street

updos and down-dos / and all in between

id be a little bit taller / a little bit baller / id play basketball / but on JV
id know some kids / but not enough to kid / around with them
ceramwrap headbands / moms famous lamb / chops and italian

wedding soup all over again

id be a majority / maybe join a sorority / vanilla bean frappe / on allowance dollar stacks

white christmas, easter may / permit test, sixteenth birthday

my party is bomb / at the american legion / ask a white boy to prom / from Cambridge Regis
plastic forks and chairs / muffled sounds / get butterflies from a boy named / Joseph brown
sometimes / i dont get the american dream / yeah im kinda ungrateful, it seems

im stressed depressed / and not even well dressed
but my closet / has neon sports bras / and i cant make an outfit?

afterschool friday? / hit up bath and body / perfume: Sunny Someday / with a hint of appleseed

i can name all the scents / i can apply eyeliner / im good at dancing i guess
and i got all my binders / from office max / because my mom wants to save money

so we can get Max (our dog) a kate spade daisy leash honey

so if i was white / i probably be privelleged / id probably inherit / beauty, convention
and still think badly of myself / id probably be different / different friends/ different lense

farsighted with whistling ability

i could tell you what ring around the rosie is really about

i could draw perfect hearts / and teach you to make perfect little stars / over the margin of / some loose leaf

so dip me in porous paint / so i can have eyebrow game / so i can have nice little tissue / packets

say ‘sue me’ / im white wash Amber Fragerty

less judement / or more judgement? white girl iphone uggs / starbucks 11:11 good luck / at your

lacrosse game / tomorrow up at / edgerly field
and it doesnt sound that great / either
