## To swim with a seal {#to-swim-with-a-seal}

art as a phenomenon came into my life because of its ability to mediate the universal as individual and the
individual as universal.


in all the education ive received around writing, ive never been instructed to explore the idea further:
writing with the intention of groundedness in both the personal realm and the collective, socialized realm
which is dictated by numerous value systems + cultural codes on narrative meaning-making. in all my
writing in school, I’ve swung the pendulum violently. I write for universal understanding, OR I write for
personal growth and relief of trauma, but never with both incentives in mind at once.


in my final year of school I struggle to reconcile my two modes of writing into one. I want to see what
happens to my writing when my attention is divided and my audience is undetermined. I wonder if there
will moments in my work which I expect to confound the reader (likely by omissions of a background
story or by logical jump) that the reader actually finds relatable after all.


I guess I want to know if experience is more universal than we realize in some indescribable way even
as we claim it and shape it to our own personal liking. in writing this translates to people responding to
your work with a sense of personal gravity even when you didn’t really write it with them in mind.
Viewing writ language as an art form is fascinating. The medium is the brain. It’s a one-stop deal in both
its production and consumption mechanisms.


`writing makes me feel more ok than a lot of other things` because its unpredictable how the concepts in
your head will fall together as words out your mouth or in the lines of red ink. im writing in red right 
now because my black pen died. The unreliability of writing is an opportunity to clarify your thought so
that language as an art can better reflect it. I like the opportunity to converse with the self in a
documented, easily managed environment.


over the summer i took a trip to central coast, california to write and simultaneously meet up w/ various
friends from Carleton. i did not want to clear my head! but instead clarify it. i took to the beach one of
those first days of the trip, the beach in capitola, california, a small town south of santa cruz made up of
surfers and elderly folk and my friend keaton who is of the former population.


i listened to a 30-second teaser of “mess,” unreleased by chelsea cutler on repeat as I watched the
waves roll and crash some yards advance of the boardwalk. i wanted to cry. but it was not raining and i
was not in the shower, two conditions that preclude a safe environment for crying. i abruptly started
running, hugging the coastline and the sand causing my feet to cave into it as soon as i started up. My
ankles were screaming from the built pressure, and I was barefoot (i was running barefoot) having left
keatons studio that morning without shoes. i ran along the cliffs where no one was supposed to go, the
DANGER sign begging me to turn around, i ran past a wounded elephant seal with eyes of peace, albeit
dying, and jumped to and fro among jagged rocks that pierced into the balls of my feet. I got to the
abandoned pier where sharks are known to come close to shore and circle around the legs of the pier
and no one was there.


when i turned around the tide was high and i was too late. i wouldn’t be able to run back, and i had run
for almost an hour to speak to the mileage. i had to swim to retrace the steps of my run back to capitola,
for now there was no sand between the cliffside and the shoreline.


The water was rough. My white tee-shirt ballooned around my chest, full of seawater. I took to
breaststroke, the only stroke that doesn’t require getting your hair wet. I turned around and an elephant
seal brushed right by me.


i recently read the journal entry I wrote in Capitola and it has nothing to do w/ Capitola. in writing i often
do not disclose information on my current affairs, yet i can recall it all easily.


after the dance with a seal and sometime later, i found dry land beneath me and headed to a two-story
cafe staffed by grungy UC santa cruz kids to finally write.


Easily, every work of writing is just a subtext that sparks a different world for every reader + writer
among the registers btwn the personal and universal.


im copying my entries written by hand and with a variable audience in mind over to my computer and
then disseminating them with very few edits as an exercise in dissolving the boundary between the ego
and the world that surrounds.

## We are all giant livers {#giant-livers}

Religion is: a hope method. Stories we tell ourselves to avoid existential dread. Way to confront
suffering and intensify joy, make homes and cross boundaries. A zero-util human invention. Think the
image of a young professional sitting in traffic in their car, searching for a trace of spiritual experience
in their vacuous lives // a means to access to the ‘inner.’ Certain kinds of social media intensify suffering
– we can’t let go of the past because everything is imbued with a false sense of permanence – to the loss
of the reflective inner. Constant stimuli, and impenetrable constancy more broadly, must give way to
anxiety and depression.


Tinder: human machine learning. I tried tinder. It is Machines training Us. to the supercomputer machine I tell it, stop
trying to force me to stretch myself across time and space. To boil a human being down to a few ascii
characters on which to judge in the span of .6 seconds. Everyone knows that short term memories are
dead because of it, as you put your past in repositories instead of your own hippocampus. Intentional
forgetting and letting go, the exercise of agency, is far more difficult because of it. Do you want to add
this person you don’t want to see again for some time, for a long time, to this group about public transit
enthusiasm? How about inviting them to this community event that’s hundred’s of miles away from them?
You think it knows you until it doesn’t at all; it doesn’t get the memo you gave your friends that things
have changed back out here. All the slight algorithmic missteps, spotify not doing a good job on your
discover weekly (it’s not robust enough to understand your taste on the sub-sub-genre level), and
iphone photos app reminding you of a ‘memory’ that’s just accidental snap of your floor on an otherwise
forgettable december 12, a good ol messaging predictive with the wrong hypothesis. All these missteps
have a lot to do with me feeling incredibly isolated and like the loneliest person in the world, 
but at the same time a little comforting to know it doesn’t know everything.


But god damn , all this consumption?? I literally forget how to produce. It helps us optimize to the point
where we mirror it, taking and taking... our own ability to know how to produce? should I expend my
own energy to create something?


So I’ll try to get outside.


Things i do to make it / me better. But things are blirry and stuff is constantly out of focus. `There is a
digital fog over my life so that is why I like the feeling of granite embedded into the side of my left hand`,
that is why I write. I grip my bike and my left pinkie is gnawed away by the fear of getting hit by a car, I
hold on to the bike handle with the strength of all my fingers and in the end only my left pinkie is left a
blistered casualty. When I’m in the zone, on my bike, the less I think trivially (the less of what I think is
trivial) is the more I think clearly and the better off I am.


I had this bike when I was younger called my depression bike. sometimes even now I feel stuck in a
mess, like im bowling with guardrails and the games I play are too constrictive and easy. the world
keeps Asking how and not why. The federal scheduling of drugs along three tiers of legal severity, and
where hallucinogens are placed within that pyramid, is an example of the world asking how and not why.
But!!! the lower-tier substances, opioids and nicotine and alcohol are faaaaar less dangerous than hallucinogens (which include marijuana, to complete this grouping of substances as 21st century contenders for treating anxiety and depression), 
*of course, that's what we all believe right*—which no one ever uses in moderation, if informed use is even
possible with such physiologically addictive compounds. Last year I was convinced the human body is
evolving into a giant liver; I told this to Camille as we tried to fall asleep and thought about if there's any way we
weren’t already one.


We are a giant liver!! What keeps you alive is what removes toxicity.


Is that the definition of living?


I think about the liminal space between our denigration and that of which we are becoming.
