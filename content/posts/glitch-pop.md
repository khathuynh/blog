Learning about how to make electronic music can be a daunting task, especially when industry equipment is so freakin expensive and where are you supposed to learn how to make edm? luckily at carleton i had the privilege to take a few music and media studies classes, where ive gotten to mess around with software and equipment i otherwise wouldn’t have access to. here are a few of my learning experiments so far! in middle school i used to go home & throw shit onto the piano roll in fl studio free trial that i would renew over and over and so im really happy that ive been able to revive my interest in music prdouction in college.

### Fall 2015 CAMS.242 sound and music in new media, 80% loops 20% composition {#beachwave}
Experiment in using mainly Logic Pro X loops to craft an ambient / electroacoustic beachy sounding track inspired by the shores of central c.a (santa cruz)….. chillwave … imagining the sounds of the place where my mom first came to the u.s.

### Fall 2015 CAMS.242 sound and music in new media, 80% samples 20% composition {#miles-and-miles}
Experiment in remixing samples. Got a little lazy and didn't perfectly sync the samples oops. Sampling from: “Midnight City” by M83, “She  Will Be Loved” by Maroon 5, “I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)” by The Proclaimers

### Fall 2018 MUSC.221 electronic music production, 70% composition 30% vocal samples {#mistake-or-design}  
Experiment in midi sequencing as composition and production in Logic Pro X DAW, largely inspired by Lana Del Rey’s “Born to Die” (“Summertime Sadness” lyrics also included). Very much rough around the edges
