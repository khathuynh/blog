## What does it mean for words and concepts to be symbiotic? {#lets-be-symbiotic}
---


Don’t ask me to translate anything in Viet, my first language. Never quite pinned down
the English translation for bánh , ubiquitous among fusion restaurant menus and guides
for Saigon street food. I fear I’m failing myself because there’s several options and
none feel right.


For new years resolution I get on Duolingo to take the Vietnamese placement test and
in turn regain a sliver of my bilingualism. Jokes on me when the green owl named Duo
ranks me at Level zero. Duo is crying! He has me tap a picture of banh mi --bread--to
get me started as I’m chuckling to myself.


English has around 171,000 words in common use (Oxford English Dictionary 2nd Edition)
and Vietnamese, 40,000 (Từ điển tiếng Việt), where, without google translate and
instead computed from within my mental webs, weaved among early childhood language
loss yielding to Anglicization, bánh maps partially to pastry , as it does to dish ,
gluten-friendly , cookie , and dessert just the same. When a word like bánh is poised
against its audience of possible English translations, I know I’ve dug up a skeleton
key: the mark of the one-to-many relationship often shared between high-context
languages (where words are defined in relation to scenario, where words work together)
and low-context ones. The latter demand precision to avoid dependencies on
environment, and so that means longer fifth grade vocabulary tests.


American english language arts (ELA) has taught me to search for the ~right~ word for
all I observe, because the world so selfishly belongs to me to describe. Translating
from English to Vietnamese makes me anxious, as if mapping in a many-to-one direction
yields a loss in the quality of whatever you are trying to represent/describe.


Likewise, as if mapping in the one-to-many direction indicates the low-context
language is grotesquely imprecise. Trying to grasp at the word for ‘pail’ one time I
beat myself up bad in stumbling among scribbles for ‘Halloween bucket’ and ‘pumpkin
basket.’ I couldn’t figure out the word for pail and i hated myself.


I think all writers and those faithful to radical change struggle with precision. I
used to think if could be more precise, i.e. critically THERE at the THING ITSELF
(whatever I am writing about or talking about or aiming at representing) instead of at
my EXPERIENCE of the THING, I would. So others recognize the THING in their own life.
So I can affect culture and change directly.


Here’s my brain on the drug of academia: if I use the ‘wrong’ or more generic word, I
will become more misunderstood than I already am and begin to feel fraudulent. I will
be told, “Please see me after class for a word on tightening your prose.”


But lately to be honest im feeling a tension with my brain. because im realizing that
my first language was Vietnamese and before I knew language, my language was
fundamentally symbiotic, just slippery concepts like food to mouth to sit to chair
working in relation to one another as bare minimum to get by as a tiny tot. Ms. Cashew
stopped me after class in seventh grade for making up a word from an existing one. I
get in trouble using a noun as a verb or verb as adjective or grouping three unrelated
things as a remixed category. Has it ever occurred to me that I might be mirroring
Viet in my attraction to writing things that read abstractly? There is new comfort in
detail that doesn’t speak for itself and in fact is nothing by itself. Words that
don’t point anywhere too specific feel like a muddy memory and at the same time like
unfogging a window of handprints.

I couldn’t be more than four, in times unfolding like a muted play-- my great grandma
strayed deceptively near as I learnt to leave well alone. With a peep she signals her
departure. The call of noontime would soon whisk her away, a mere few minutes down a
beaten path, her sandals pressing into dirt as she bartered with neighbors on their
doorsteps. In curt exchanges, bamboo-woven baskets and fumes, collecting vapor among
the humidity of monsoon season, dampened her elder hands. Facing home, she’d prove
loyal in promise kept to her great-granddaughter: a bowl of bánh canh. Child’s treat.
At times memory is photographic.


But do you know how more often than not, you can “feel” the fabric of a memory,though
not really recall it exactly? Like a mashed potato of incongruent details?

## Prime directive {#prime-directive}

Asked about my process of writing, I have become less concerned with misrepresentation
among English audiences, building on these modes:
- Deformalizing verb tenses
- Cutting out ‘a’ and ‘the’ and prepositions which place and relate things in
exact tones and position
- Taking nouns that seem scientific and humanizing them, applying appropriate
degrees of granularity and measurability to the social sphere


Over years I’ve been writing to myself and small circles but it’s come to a point
where the process is thinking politically-- inevitably. No longer about (or at least
solely about) “copying my entries written by hand and with a variable audience in mind
over to my computer and then disseminating them with very few edits as an exercise in
dissolving the boundary between the ego and the world that surrounds“ or “applying the
universal method of transience ” in an apolitical space apart from hegemony where
everyone is safe in their skin . It’s come to a point where if i keep this up i could
capture a personal style in modes where people can see sharply what does living with a
third cultural psyche mean and how do intersections (intersectionality as buzzwordly
evasive idea) govern our ways of organizing the world || how do i perceive moving
along a one-to-many, many-to-one continuum in art and discourse. With heart I must
articulate these experiences in a way that’s impactful and bounds us together versus
pushing and shoving the minds of others sympathetically.


Though I will always remember: We like to see language or art approach a replacement
function as a substitute for life itself, especially as artists and social critics
infatuated. The fine line we walk is to glean from a book of fiction or analysis
(benign) and to exert caution when academia interchanges with lived experience (danger
in reward).


I’m itching a scratch that might just take up all my days
