## ~~~~ BIG SALE ~~~~
From a marketing perspective, articles at the awkward length of 8 pages single spaced would never sell.
So I gift this to you for free!!! **BUY 0 GET 53 FREE!**

I hope this finds you floating and I really mean it.

A multi-year series of longer form essays which began as personal journal entries circulated among an email list of friends.
There are times where I've thrown my journal the trash just to fish it back out and there are times where I starve for the ocean, wide horizons, and growing pains. 
When all I know is crushing loneliness, comes the highlight reel of creative moments and connection.

A cast out for love to my family and friends, if a bit sloppy.

In a some way I hope this may soothe you.
