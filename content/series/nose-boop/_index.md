From a marketing perspective, articles at the awkward length of 8 pages single spaced would never sell.

*Nose boop* is a multi-year series of longer form essays which began as personal journal entries. Circulating these among an email list of friends, I liked to think of them as a digital boop on the nose.
There were times where I've thrown my journal the trash just to fish it back out and there are times where I starve for the ocean, wide horizons and tough moods to get through it all. 
I write the growing pains I'll never resolve, the flush of connection which never subsides.

A cast out for love to my family and friends, if a tad sloppy.

In some way I hope this may soothe you. I really mean it
